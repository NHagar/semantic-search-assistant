   - Total estimated size/scope
   - Primary language(s)
   - General purpose or domain

2. **MAIN CATEGORIES** (List each with description)
   - Category name
   - Estimated percentage of corpus
   - Key characteristics
   - Example titles

3. **DOCUMENT TYPES IDENTIFIED**
   - Format (articles, reports, blogs, etc.)
   - Length indicators
   - Formal vs informal tone
   - Technical level

4. **KEY THEMES AND TOPICS**
   - Major subject areas (list top 5-10)
   - Recurring concepts or terminology
   - Notable patterns or trends

5. **SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS**
   - Unique or unusual documents
   - Time period covered (if apparent)
   - Geographic focus (if any)
   - Target audience indicators

6. **DATA QUALITY NOTES**
   - Completeness of samples
   - Consistency issues observed
   - Potential biases or gaps

Be specific and use concrete examples from the sample. When uncertain, indicate your confidence level. Focus on patterns that appear in multiple documents rather than single instances.
